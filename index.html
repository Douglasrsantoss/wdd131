                <p id="about-me">
                My name is Douglas but everyone in my family calls me Dodô for short.
                I was born and raised in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.
                I graduated in Mechanical Engineering in São Paulo, Brazil and got married there.
                My wife and I have a beautiful daughter and we're expecting our second daughter to born in the end of July.

                        Brazil is the 5th largest country in the world.
                        It is located in South America, in the America Continent.
                        It is home for the largest rain forest in the world and (unfortunately) very famous for the Carnaval fest that happens every year.
                        Brasilians are very receptive and cleaver. Prof of that is we invented the first airplane that actually flew by itself.
